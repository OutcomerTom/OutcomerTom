### Hi, I am Tom ðŸ‘‹

For the last several years I have been dealing with graphic design. It was a natural step for me to become a front end developer. 

I use **HTML**, **CSS** and **javascript** on a daily basis. I use **Bootstrap**, **Vue.js**, **Git** and **GitHub**, and also Adobeâ€™s graphics toolkit. 

I pay attention to details, which is a consequence of my previous professional experience.
I am a meticulous and conscientious person. I have communication skills and I am proactive.
I am characterized by out of the box thinking.
