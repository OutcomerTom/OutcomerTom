### Hi, I am Tom ðŸ‘‹

I have several years of experience in graphic design including web technologies; like World Press, WooCommerce, and archaic Flash. 
I used to do Web banners, and Allegro templates in PHP, and design Websites, single pages, mini-sites, and landing pages from scratch.
Now, I work with **front-end stack technologies**, such as Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap, MUI, netlify, etc. 
How can I help you?
